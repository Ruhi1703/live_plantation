                                In 1989, NASA discovered that houseplants can absorb harmful toxins from the air,
                                especially
                                closed spaces with little air flow. This study has been the basis for newer studies
                                about indoor
                                plants and their air cleaning abilities.
                                While plants have less horse power than air purifiers, they are more natural, cost
                                effective,
                                and therapeutic.
